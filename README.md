# Price Market Analysis
### This project is being developed with almost minimal knowledge
___
This project does not pursue a commercial goal, but is written for the sake of interest, at least it was at the beginning :)
And so its goal is to analyze a certain sample of exact goods, and create a dynamic table for quarters of time.
The data will be collected by Python, a JavaScript frontend, and a database, most likely PostgreSQL

In the course of creating a project, its goals will be adjusted, in principle, this is normal!

# Small notes
At the time of the existence of this header, the code is written synchronously, meaning that the code that is in python collects data on the prices of the secondary car market in the Russian Federation.

After the synchronous data collection code is complete, i.e. without having more than two nested loops and other bad examples.
Further, the code will be rewritten under aiohttp - so, if I'm not mistaken.
